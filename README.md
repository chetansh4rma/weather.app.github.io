# Weather App

This is a weather app that allows users to search for the weather in any city. The app uses the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data.

## Getting Started

To get started, clone the repository and install the dependencies.

```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/weather-app.git
cd weather-app
npm install
```

## Running the App

To run the app, start the development server.

```
npm start
```

The app will be available at http://localhost:3000.

## Using the App

To use the app, enter the name of a city in the search bar and click the "Get Weather" button. The app will then fetch the weather data for the city and display it on the screen.

## Code Explanation

The code for the weather app is divided into three files:

* `index.html`: This file contains the HTML code for the app.
* `script.js`: This file contains the JavaScript code for the app.
* `style.css`: This file contains the CSS code for the app.

The HTML code for the app is fairly straightforward. It consists of a header, a main section, and a footer. The header contains the title of the app and a search bar. The main section contains the weather data for the city that the user has searched for. The footer contains the copyright information for the app.

The JavaScript code for the app is more complex. It consists of a function that fetches the weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API and a function that displays the weather data on the screen. The function that fetches the weather data takes the city name as an argument and makes a request to the OpenWeatherMap API. The function then parses the response from the API and returns the weather data. The function that displays the weather data takes the weather data as an argument and updates the HTML code on the screen with the weather data.

The CSS code for the app is used to style the app. It consists of a set of rules that specify the colors, fonts, and sizes of the elements on the screen.

## Conclusion

This weather app is a simple but powerful tool that can be used to fetch weather data for any city in the world. The app is easy to use and understand, and it can be customized to meet the needs of any user.
